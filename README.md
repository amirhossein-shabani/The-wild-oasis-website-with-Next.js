# 🌴 The Wild Oasis Website

A modern web application for **The Wild Oasis Hotel**, where users can explore cabins, learn more about the hotel, and make reservations.

This project was built as part of the [Jonas Schmedtmann's Next.js course](https://www.udemy.com/) on Udemy. During the development of this project, I gained practical experience using **Next.js** and building full-featured, interactive web apps.
